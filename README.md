# How many neurons are needed to make a short-term predictions of the Bitcoin exchange rate?

## Abstract
The goal of our work was to select a neural network architecture that would give the best prediction of the Bitcoin exchange rate using historical data. Our work fits into the very important topic of predicting the value of a cryptocurrency exchange rate, and makes use of recent data which, as a result of the high Bitcoin exchange rate dynamics of the last year, differs significantly from those of earlier years. We propose and test a number of neural network-based architectures and conduct a discussion of the results. Unlike previous state-of-the art works, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of three different neural network-based models: MLP (multilayer perceptron), LSTM (long short-term memory) and CNN (convolutional neural network). We have tested them for a wide range of parameters. The results we present are, to the best of our knowledge, the most up-to-date when it comes to the application of artificial intelligence methods for cryptocurrency exchange rate prediction. Best performing architectures was used for a website that gives real-time predictions of the Bitcoin exchange rate.
